# Spring Pet Clinic

The main goal of the this application to get more in touch with Spring, SpringBoot and all the conventions, also to catch up a bit with Java, after years not being one of the top 5 languages I was using. The Pet Clinic itself is a [instructional application](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic), for starters of Spring's world.
